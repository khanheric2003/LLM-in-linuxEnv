AI-Powered Linux Coding Assistant (sort of like Devin)
This project features an LLM (Large Language Model) that interacts with a simulated Linux environment. It can:
- Execute code within the environment.
- Analyze the output and provide feedback to itself.
- fix the code by themselve.
By continuously refining its own code, the assistant enhances efficiency and correctness in a self-improving workflow.
